WHAT?
====================================================================
Jsb (Javascript Builder) is a small dsl written in Java to generate
Javascript.



WHY?
====================================================================
I'm not sure. You probably shouldn't use this and stick to writing
javascript in.. javascript. However, if you do for some reason need
to generate javascript at runtime from Java, then using this might
be marginally better than embedding js code in your java files.



USAGE EXAMPLES
====================================================================
Look at the tests for examples.



CAVEAT
====================================================================
I've never actually used this myself and it's pretty quick-n-dirty.
Use at your own peril.
